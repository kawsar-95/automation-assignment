Here’s a simple `README.md` file that outlines the steps to set up and run a Playwright test suite. You can customize it to fit your specific Playwright project.

```md
# Playwright Test Automation

This repository contains automated tests built using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

## Prerequisites

Before running the Playwright tests, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v12.0.0 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to install dependencies and run the Playwright tests.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kawsar-95/automation-assignment.git
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Install Playwright Browsers

Playwright comes with its own set of browsers. To install them, use:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### 4. Run Playwright Tests

To run all Playwright tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

### 5. Run a Specific Test File

To run a specific test, you can specify the file path like this:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/example.spec.js
```

### 6. View Test Report

Playwright generates a test report that you can view in your browser. After running the tests, open the HTML report using:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### 7. Debug Mode

You can run tests in headed mode (with the browser UI) for debugging:

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

### 8. Running Tests with Trace Viewer

To enable tracing for debugging purposes:

```bash
npx playwright test --trace on
```

After running tests with traces, open the trace viewer using:

```bash
npx playwright show-trace <trace-file>
```

## Folder Structure

```bash
.
├── tests/                # Test files go here
│   └── assignment.spec.js   # Example test file
    └── assignment.spec.js-snapshots # contains snapshots of visual tests
├── playwright.config.js  # Playwright configuration file
└── README.md             # This file
```
