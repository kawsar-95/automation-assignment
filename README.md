# Sauce Demo App Automation

This project automates testing of the Sauce Demo web application using **Playwright**. It covers functionalities like logging in, sorting products, adding items to the cart, and completing the checkout process. Additionally, **accessibility** and **visual** testing capabilities have been integrated to ensure the app is user-friendly and visually correct across pages. The **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern is employed for code structure.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure that you have the latest version installed. Download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Playwright**: The Playwright testing framework is used to automate browser actions. Learn more at [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
- **IDE**: It is recommended to use **Visual Studio Code** for development.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository** using your preferred command line tool:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Sauce-Demo-App-Automation
   ```
2. **Install dependencies** and Playwright:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install @playwright/test
   ```

## Running Tests

### Functional Tests

1. **Test Execution**:
   i. **Headless mode**: Run the default set of functional tests using Playwright. Execute:

   ```bash
   npm run sauce-demo-test
   ```

   ii. **Headed mode**: Run the default set of functional tests using Playwright headed mode. Execute:

   ```bash
    npx playwright test --ui 
   ```
2. **Results**: View test reports after execution. A browser window will display a detailed breakdown of passed and failed tests.


### Test Details

#### Overview

This suite tests various key functionalities of the Sauce Demo app, including logging in, sorting products, adding items to the cart, and checking out. The **Page Object Model (POM)** is used to organize test scripts for maintainability.

- **Login Test**: Verifies user authentication functionality.
- **Inventory Sorting**: Ensures products can be sorted by name (Z-A) and price (high to low).
- **Cart Management**: Adds multiple products to the cart and verifies the cart contents.
- **Checkout Process**: Completes the checkout process and validates order confirmation.

#### Test Scenarios

##### **Login Test**:

- Fills in login credentials and asserts that the user is logged in successfully.

##### **Sorting Tests**:

- Verifies that products are sorted correctly by name (Z-A) and by price (high to low).

##### **Cart Test**:

- Adds multiple items to the cart and verifies that all items are correctly listed in the cart.

##### **Checkout Test**:

- Completes the checkout process and confirms that the correct order confirmation message is displayed.

### Page Object Model (POM)


### Best Practices

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: This design pattern enhances test maintainability and readability by separating page-specific actions into dedicated classes.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Tests focus on a single piece of functionality, making them easier to understand, debug, and maintain.
- **Reusability**: Common actions, such as logging in and sorting products, are encapsulated in reusable methods within their respective page classes.
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure that the app complies with accessibility standards, making it usable for all users.
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Incorporate visual regression testing to validate that the app's visual elements remain consistent and that no unintended UI changes occur.

## Reporting

- **Functional Tests**: Playwright generates a detailed report after test execution. View it by running:

  ```bash
  npx playwright show-report
  ```
- **Accessibility Report**: Accessibility issues will be highlighted directly in the console output.
- **Visual Report**: View the differences between baseline and actual images in the `/backstop_data/html` folder, generated by jest-image-snapshot.
